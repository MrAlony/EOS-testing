# Placeholder for EOS SDK
# Download from: https://dev.epicgames.com/portal
#
# Extract the SDK so the structure is:
# external/eos-sdk/
# ├── Include/
# │   └── eos_sdk.h (and other headers)
# ├── Lib/
# │   └── EOSSDK-Win64-Shipping.lib
# └── Bin/
#     └── EOSSDK-Win64-Shipping.dll

This directory should contain the Epic Online Services SDK.

Without the SDK, the project builds in "stub mode" which simulates
all EOS functionality for testing purposes.
